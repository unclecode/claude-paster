# ClaudePaster

Seeing lots of folks annoyed when Claude turns their long pastes into attachments? Yeah, me too. That's why I built ClaudePaster - a simple Chrome extension that lets you paste lengthy content without it converting to attachments automatically.

## What it does
- Prevents Claude from auto-converting long text pastes into attachments
- Gives you full control over your text input
- Simple toggle in settings to enable/disable when needed

2. Open Chrome and navigate to `chrome://extensions/`

## How to use
Once installed, just paste your content as usual in Claude - no more automatic attachments! If you ever need the original behavior, you can disable the extension through its settings.
